/**
 * BlackjackGame coordinates the game flow.
 *
 * This class represents the "game controller" of the application.
 * It connects the Deck and Player objects together, but it does not do
 * all the work itself.
 *
 * It has:
 * - one Deck
 * - many Players
 *
 * Important OOP idea:
 * This class does NOT calculate card values directly.
 * It asks the Player and Hand objects for that information.
 *
 * This keeps the classes loosely coupled and gives each class
 * a clear responsibility.
